## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

Creating new variables, steps 1-3

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
f<-file.choose() #choose my dataset
d<- read_csv(f, col_names = TRUE)
names(d) #view my variable names
BSD<- d$Body_mass_male_mean/d$Body_mass_female_mean #new variable body size dimorphism
sex_ratio<- d$AdultFemale/d$AdultMales #new variable 
DI<- d$DayLength_km/d$HomeRange_km2# new variable defensibility index
```
Plotting
```{r}
ggplot()




```
